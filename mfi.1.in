.SH NAME
mfi \- continually restart a server
\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
mfi [-hVS] [command...]
\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR mfi (1)
restarts a program constantly, waiting on any children that are
reparented to it. It was originally meant as a PID1, and thus has some
odd 'quirks' for non-PID1 use:
\"
.RS
\(bu Unless --no-signals is given, signals are masked by default,
except for those listed in
.BR SIGNALS .
.LP
\(bu SIGUSR1 must be sent within five seconds of startup to confirm
success.
.LP
\(bu If no command is given, a default command is used instead.
.RE
\"
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Display the help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Display the version number and copyright information and exit.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-command
Print the command (escaped) that will be executed.
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-no\-signals
Disable setting of signal handlers.
\"
.SH RETURN CODES
.B mfi
exits with 0 on success, or 1 on failure.
\"
.SH SIGNALS
.B mfi
uses signals as a core component of its architecture. The following
signals will be used in the specified way:
.SS "Default"
SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be handled by
.B mfi
(see
.BR sigprocmask (3))
and thus will be dealt with normally.
\"
.SS "Die (if sent by the kernel)"
SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, SIGBUS and SIGILL indicate a bug in the program, and
will cause a crash if sent by the kernel.

SIGABRT indicates an assertion failure, and will also only be
recognized from the kernel and itself.

SIGALRM indicates the five-second timer failed.

SIGINT will be respected if it comes from PID 0 (i.e. the controlling
terminal).
\"
.SS "Special"
If SIGUSR1 is received from the child, the timer will be unset, since
the child is clearly alive. (Note that only the child's PID is
recognized.)
\"
.SS "Future"
SIGUSR2 may be used for something else, perhaps with
.BR sigqueue (2).

SIGQUIT or SIGTERM may be allowed for graceful shutdown.

SIGIO may be used for IO in a future version while we block on
.BR wait (2).
\"
.SH BUGS
The program is still too PID1-specific. Only Linux has been tested.
.SS Reporting
Report bugs to @PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@.
